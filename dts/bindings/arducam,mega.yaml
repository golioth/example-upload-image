  The Arducam Mega is a digital camera with an SPI interface.

  Add the Arducam as a subnode of an SPI peripheral:

  &spi2 {
    status = "okay";
    cs-gpios = <&gpio0 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    arducam: arducam@0 {
      compatible = "arducam,mega";
      reg = <0>;
      spi-max-frequency = <8000000>;
    };
  };

  Above:

  - A Chip-select pin has been specified for spi2 using the
    cs-gpios property. The cs-gpio may be omitted if it is
    already set in the board definition.

  Note:

  - The library controls the CS pin. For boards that have
    hardware-controlled chip-select it is necessary to remove
    the hardware-based CS assignment using pinctrl. The ESP32
    is one example of this.

compatible: "arducam,mega"

include: [spi-device.yaml]
